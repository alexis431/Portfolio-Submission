# Portfolio-Submission
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The client was The Gaming Room, this client had a game called Draw it or Lose it but for Androids. They wanted to improve the functionality of the new game and let it expand to other platforms and users. 
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- The document I created for them was clear and to the point for their game.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- It helps you focus on what your priorities should be and what taks are most important, which ones you should and shouldn't focus on
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would say the evaluation because I wasn't as familiar with linux as I was with the rest. I would improve it by simply learning more about it which I did. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- I took what the functionality of the game and helped split it up so that there would be less work and time spend expanding to other operating platforms. All while still keeping the game the same. Your client may be the one to ask you to do the work but it is the user's who truely control the product. If they don't trust the software or have problems with it then they won't use it and no more product
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- I approach it by being sure I kept my focus on a clear document, that way when the client reviewed it they understood clearly. I would use techniques like the game and the games needs to function, the maintanence and updates.
